Tiny Search Engine is a program that crawls through webpages, indexes them by doc ID and word count, and then allows users to search through webpages for specific words.

### Usage
The global `make all` creates four directories, `common`, `crawler`, `indexer`, and `querier`. Specific information can be found in each directories respective `README.md`'s. `libcs50` needs to be made or included for the program to run properly.

### Directories:
* `common`: all shared modules
* `crawler`: crawler directory
* `indexer`: indexer directory
* `querier`: querier directory
* `libcs50`: given libcs50 library
